# Ignite Maps Plugin

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/infinitered/ignite-maps.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This plugin adds [react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps)
to your [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) React Native project and
configures it so it works out of the box with Ignite projects. It also includes
a couple generators to help you quickly add map components and callouts.
